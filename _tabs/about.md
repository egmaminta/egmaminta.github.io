### 👋 Hi, nice to meet you! I'm Emmanuel G. Maminta.

* 🎓 Artificial Intelligence Ph.D. student (*ongoing; expected 2027*)
* 🏫 University of the Philippines
* 📍 Metro Manila, Philippines
* 📧 egmaminta [at] up.edu.ph

#### Short Bio

I am a fourth-year Artificial Intelligence Ph.D. student at the [Ubiquitous Computing Laboratory](https://eee.upd.edu.ph/research/research-laboratories/ubiquitous-computing-laboratory/) (UCL) in the [University of the Philippines](https://upd.edu.ph/), advised by Prof. [Rowel O. Atienza](https://eee.upd.edu.ph/about/faculty/rowel-atienza/).

I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering (B.S. EE) with honors in 2022, and my Master of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence (M.Eng. AI) in 2025, both from the University of the Philippines. I have gained more than half a decade of experience in research and development, software engineering, and project management, with a focus on the field of AI and Machine Learning (ML).

My **primary** research interests are the following:
- Embodied AI agents or agentic AI, and their applications in the retail industry (Retail Intelligence)
- Multimodal deep learning (vision & language) including fusion techniques, foundation models (FMs), and vision language models (VLMs)
- Pre-training methods and how to efficiently utilize single GPU resource for such methods
- Reinforcement learning-based post-training methods in large language models (LLMs), specifically reward modeling, preference learning, and policy optimization algorithms
- Computer vision including out-of-vocabulary (or in-the-wild) object detection and image segmentation

Other research interests include: AI safety and alignment, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring, prompt optimization.
